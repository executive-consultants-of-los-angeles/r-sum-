Pretentious Bullshit About Résumé Sections
==========================================

A Section of a Résumé
------------------------------

In this context a section is the first level of categorization applied to a person's résumé.  That is to say, there is the résumé as a holistic entity, then that is (generally) broken up into constituent parts in order to tell a story that presents the most appealing version of the subject as possible. 

There are further divisions of the data in a résumé, but implementing them in a relational database is clumsy and awkward.  Or at least the author isn't smart enough to make it not clumsy and awkward.  For the sake of this software, there will be only the two layers: the document itself and its sections.
