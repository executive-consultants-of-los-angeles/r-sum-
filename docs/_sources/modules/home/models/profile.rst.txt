Pretentious Bullshit About Résumés
==================================

What do we mean by profile?
---------------------------

A profile is a résumé.

Why don't we just call it a résumé like everyone else?
------------------------------------------------------

Because everyone else *actually* calls it a resume, which is a verb meaning to continue.  The author believes this is due mostly to the lack of an `é` on the U.S. format keyboard. This means that in order to input `é` into a word processor or email program, people have to go out of their way to discover how to input characters that aren't on their keyboard into that program.  This is not something people are good at doing, and so it doesn't get done.  This drives the author nuts, but no one else seems to really know or care about the yawning chasm between the meanings of the two different words.
